# gyminia

A personal Flutter project developed in order to participate in Google Gemini Contest. GymInAi is an App created to give some guidelines and first steps to someone who wants to get into fitness.

## About the Author

I'm Pablo Oshiro, I've been working as a Flutter developer for more than 2 years and this is a project in which I wanted to expand my knowledge about Clean Architecture and State Management.

## About the Project

As a proof of concept, I'm really happy with the result of the App. Not only because I was able to get consistent responses from de AI, but also because I managed to get a minimalist yet very flexible and scalable UI. Since I developed the whole project by my own, I needed to focus on crucial aspects of it such as a simple, yet interesting UI. I also tried to make the app as Flutter native as I could because for me it wasn't an objective to have the prettiest app (I'm not a dessigner) but to see how simple it could be in order to test the capability of the AI.

## Future development lines

In order to make the app evolve, I'm well aware of the following steps I would take:
 - More parameters in order to refine the programs proposed by the AI.
 - A local database in order to save your proposed program.
 - Some inputs about every exercise, such as repetitions done, weights, fatigue state after the exercise, etc...

## Conclusion

With this project I don't pretend to give test an extensive implementation of Gemini AI but rather to focus on one usecase, and plan diferent fitness programs depending on varying parameters, and proof it is really simple to build a reliable and scalable app.
